# Contacts Example

A Remix 3 contacts manager showcasing [@loopui/data](../../../packages/data) and [@loopui/navigator](../../../packages/navigator) features. It adapts the [React Router address book tutorial](https://reactrouter.com/tutorials/address-book) to run entirely on the client while reusing the same patterns.

## Getting Started

Run the commands inside `fixtures/remix/contacts`:

```sh
mise install
mise run :dev
```
